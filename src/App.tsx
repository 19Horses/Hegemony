          <br />
          We believe that Black and oppressed people will not be free until we
          are able to determine our destinies in our own communities ourselves,
          by fully controlling all the institutions which exist in our

          We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to
          give every person employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that
          if the American businessmen will not give full employment, then the
          technology and means of production should be taken from the
          businessmen and placed in the community so that the people of the
          community can organize and employ all of its people and give a high
          standard of living.

          <br />
          We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are
          demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres
          and two mules were promised 100 years ago as restitution for slave
          labor and mass murder of Black people. We will accept the payment in
          currency which will be distributed to our many communities. The
          American racist has taken part in the slaughter of our fifty million
          Black people. Therefore, we feel this is a modest demand that we make.

          Black and oppressed communities, then housing and the land should be
          made into cooperatives so that the people in our communities, with
          government aid, can build and make decent housing for the people.
